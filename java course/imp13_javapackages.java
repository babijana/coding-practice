/*if we want to add the class which is in another foalder we want to import that and use it
if two classes are in tools foalder and i want to use those in another foalder 
(import tools.calc; , import tools.advcalc)
if i want all the files in that foalder (import tools.*;)
java defalty have files (java.lang*;) these are defaulty imported by java

if wehave a foalder in a foalder and that foalder have a file we can impotr that like(import other.tools.calc;)
(import others.*;) do not import the files in another foalder in it


if we want to use a variable or mathod we want to make public that
we can use it if it is in same foalder even we not make it public

if we make private we can only acess it in that class

if me make it default we can use it in same package

if me make it protected we cant use it out side the package i we want to us eit it should be sub class
we can use it in same package
